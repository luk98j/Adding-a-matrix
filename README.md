# Adding-a-matrix
One of my first object-oriented programs in c++.
Enter the height and width of the matrix.
Next step is to entering numbers following space

For example:


Height: 4 
Width: 4

1 4 6 7
2 5 5 5
3 2 8 9
4 3 2 1

7 9 9 1
3 2 1 1
8 8 8 8
2 1 0 1
    
The result is the sum of the two matrices.

8 13 15 8
5 7 6 6
11 10 16 17
6 4 2 2
